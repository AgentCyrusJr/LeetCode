Given a list of points that form a polygon when joined sequentially, find if this polygon is convex (Convex polygon definition).

Note:

There are at least 3 and at most 10,000 points.
Coordinates are in the range -10,000 to 10,000.
You may assume the polygon formed by given points is always a simple polygon (Simple polygon definition). In other words, we ensure that exactly two edges intersect at each vertex, and that edges otherwise don't intersect each other.
Example 1:

[[0,0],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0]]

Answer: True

Example 2:

[[0,0],[0,10],[10,10],[10,0],[5,5]]

Answer: False

    public boolean isConvex(List<List<Integer>> points) {
        int prev = 0;
        int cross_product =0;
        for(int i = 0; i <points.size(); i++){
            int p0x = points.get(i%points.size()).get(0), p0y = points.get(i%points.size()).get(1);
            int p1x = points.get((i+1)%points.size()).get(0), p1y = points.get((i+1)%points.size()).get(1);
            int p2x = points.get((i+2)%points.size()).get(0), p2y = points.get((i+2)%points.size()).get(1);
            
            cross_product = (p1x-p0x)*(p2y-p0y) - (p2x-p0x)*(p1y-p0y);
            
            if(cross_product == 0) continue;
            if((prev>0 && cross_product<0) || (prev < 0 && cross_product > 0)) return false;
            prev = cross_product;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
