There are 1000 buckets, one and only one of them contains poison, the rest are filled with water. They all look the same. If a pig drinks that poison it will die within 15 minutes. What is the minimum amount of pigs you need to figure out which bucket contains the poison within one hour.

Answer this question, and write an algorithm for the follow-up general case.

Follow-up:

If there are n buckets and a pig drinking poison will die within m minutes, how many pigs (x) you need to figure out the "poison" bucket within p minutes? There is exact one bucket with poison.
=====================codes=================
public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
        int status = minutesToTest/minutesToDie + 1;
        int num_of_pig = 0;
        while(Math.pow(status, num_of_pig) < buckets) {num_of_pig++;}
        return num_of_pig;
    }
    
    
==================
This is a Math problem.
The table below shows how it works, n denotes the pig, and s is associated with each status of the pig. 
for each pig, there is t+1 status, which is death in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th time slot and live eventually. 
Therefore the question is asking for how many pigs can denote 1000 in 5-nary number system.
======================
    n1  n2  n3  n4  n5
s1  1   0   0   1   0
s2  0   0   0   0   1   
s3  0   1   0   0   0
s4  0   0   0   0   0
s5  0   0   1   0   0
======================
In this case, the number is 13012 in 5-nary number system.
