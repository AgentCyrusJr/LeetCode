There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?

public class Solution {
    
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int[] res = new int[ratings.length];
        Arrays.fill(res,1);
        for(int i = 1; i< ratings.length; i++){
            if(ratings[i-1]<ratings[i]){
                res[i] = res[i-1]+1;
            }
        }
        
        for(int i = ratings.length-1; i >0; i--){
            if(ratings[i-1]>ratings[i]){
                res[i-1] = Math.max(res[i]+1,res[i-1]);
