Determine if a Sudoku is valid, according to: Sudoku Puzzles - The Rules.

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.

Note:
A valid Sudoku board (partially filled) is not necessarily solvable. Only the filled cells need to be validated.

Collect the set of things we see, encoded as strings. For example:

'4' in row 7 is encoded as "(4)7".
'4' in column 7 is encoded as "7(4)".
'4' in the top-right block is encoded as "0(4)2".
Scream false if we ever fail to add something because it was already added (i.e., seen before).

public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
    Set seen = new HashSet();
    for (int i=0; i<9; ++i) {
        for (int j=0; j<9; ++j) {
            if (board[i][j] != '.') {
                String b = "(" + board[i][j] + ")";
                if (!seen.add(b + i) || !seen.add(j + b) || !seen.add(i/3 + b + j/3))
                    return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}
