Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

Example 1:
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
Note:

The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000

public class Solution {

        int count = 0;
        int max = 0;
        for(int i : nums){
            if(i == 1){
                count++;
            }else{
                if(count>max) max = count;
                count = 0;
            }
        }
        if(count>max) max = count;
        return max;
