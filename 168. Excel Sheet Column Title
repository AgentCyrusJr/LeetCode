Given a positive integer, return its corresponding column title as appear in an Excel sheet.

For example:

    1 -> A
    2 -> B
    3 -> C
    ...
    26 -> Z
    27 -> AA
    28 -> AB

public class Solution {
    public String convertToTitle(int n) {
    	  String ss = "";  
        //firstly, I compute the residual of n, 
        //since, in this case, the problem is 1-based, so, (n+25)%26 makes sense
        //but be careful of the bound issue
    	  int residual;
    	  if(n <= 0) return ss;
    	  if(n > Integer.MAX_VALUE-25){
    	      residual = (n-1)%26;
    	  }else
    	      residual = (n+25)%26;
    	  //last char in the string first.
        ss = ""+(char)('A'+residual);
        //then I check the num of 26s is n, also be careful of 1-based case  
    	  while((n-1)/26!=0){
             //q is the num of 26s n has
             //in this case, for example, 52 has only one 26, because there is a residual of 26(which to be precise 26-1) at the beginning
    		     int q = (n-1)/26;
             //if q greater than or equal to 26, which means n has more than two digits
             //I iteratively get its last digit value by int rq = (q+25)%26;
    		     if(q>=26){
    			      int rq = (q+25)%26;
    		        ss = "" + (char)('A'+rq)+ss;
    		     }else
    			      ss = "" + (char)('A'+q-1)+ss;
