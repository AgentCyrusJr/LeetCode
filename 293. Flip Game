You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid move.

For example, given s = "++++", after one move, it may become one of the following states:

[
  "--++",
  "+--+",
  "++--"
]

public class Solution {
    public List<String> generatePossibleNextMoves(String s) {
        List<String> list =  new ArrayList<String>();
        char[] ch = s.toCharArray();
        for(int i = 1; i < ch.length; i++){
        	char[] copy = s.toCharArray();
        	if(ch[i-1]=='+' && ch[i]=='+'){
        		copy[i-1]	= '-';
        		copy[i]		= '-';
        		list.add(new String(copy));
        	}else{
        		continue;
        	}
        }
        return list;
    }
}
